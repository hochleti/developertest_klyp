## Developer Test

### Overview
I have created a simple website with a search funcitonality. The homepage of the website displays movies in card design. Each movie links to another page which outlines their details such as title year and image. There is a search bar on the homepage to search for movies containing any of the following words: red, green, blue or yellow. The search output will then display movies that has a matching word in their titles with any of the colours. 

### Technical Aspect
- The website is built with Lavarel, following the MVC model. 
- CSS and Bootstrap are used to style the web pages
- phpMyAdmin and MySQL are used to create, populate and manage the database.
